# T1A3-Terminal-Assignment
# Track Employee Work Hours

## Overview:
- This app is designed to allow employees to log and track their shifts. It will provide users with a report on the total amount of hours they have worked within a weekly or fortnightly basis. 

### Feature 1: User can make and edit shift details
- Users are able to input their rostered shift hours 
- Users are able to add new shift details 

### Feature 2: Calculate total hours worked 
- The total hours worked per week or per fortnight will be calculated based upon the shift start/end time and the date provided by the user 

### Feature 3: Error handling for user input and file operations 

### Feature 4: Save to JSON file 

### Feature 5: Load data from JSON file 

## What the features need to include:
- Walkthrough of the logic of the application
- Ensure features demonstrate your understanding of the use of variables and the concept of variable scope, loops and conditional control structures and error handling 


## Help Documentation:
- Decribe how to use and install the application
- Steps to install the application 
- Any dependencies required by the application to operate 
- Any system/hardware requirements 
- How to use any command line arguments made for the application 

## Implementation plan
- Outline how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature 
- Prioritise the implementation of different features or checklist items within a feature 
- Provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist - item 

## Project management platform to track this implementation plan 
- Screenshots/images to an accessible project management platform to track this (trello)
- Checklist feature has to have at least 5 items 
- Create flowchart on draw.io or something similar to explain logic  

### Requirements File 
- Different packages you will be using in your project 
- Depends on the use case 
- Specific versions within the libraries listed 
- For other people who download the project can easily run it without any hassle 

### Virtual Environments
- Help create isolated environments for projects, ensuring each project has its own dependencies (each packages you install for yourself)

## Pytest
- Power and user-friendly testing framework 
- Simple yet powerful package/library 
- Assert (logic/condition true or false value if its true then nothing happens, if its false then it throws an assertion error message)
- Use assert in project testing, make sure our logic is working properly to make sure the output retrieved is the output we expected
- Pytest follows the principle of asserting and that things are true in order for a test to pass, for a test to pass the assert value must be true 

## Error Handling
- Try 
- Value error 

## Initialising 
- Initialising packages to use them in other folders  

## File Handling 
- Read and write data from and to files 
- Open file first, make changes and then close the files 

## Referenced Sources

## Link to source control repository 

## Code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to (rerference chosen style guide appropriately)

## Commenting 
- Indention
- Define function, what is it about, what types of argument it accepts, and what output you expect from that specfic function  

## Important things to note for the README:
- And generally, for the class: just remembering the portfolio submissions -- please, please, please, confirm that you can run your submission in its submission structure before submitting it. We can NOT edit your submissions. If your submission does not work for you, it will not work for us. 

- Part of the assessment is to write instructions on how to run your app - this is what those instructions should be for. 
If we have to cd into a specific directory to run things, make sure that's noted.

- If you feel like you have to completely rearrange your project to meet the submission structure: stop. Just make new folders for the submission ZIP, move your terminal project into the src folder of the submission folders, and make sure the instruction in the submission readme says to cd into the src/YourProjectHere folder.
